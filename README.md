This repository is the source of [forsen.horse](https://forsen.horse/) website. It was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The website is actually a bunch of Forsen-related stuff. "Games and shit", as some might say.

## Sections

* [Forsle](https://forsen.horse/): daily Forsen game (home page)
  * Each day you'll get a frame from Forsen's vod. Your task is to guess the date of the stream.
  * Return daily for new screenshots. Game keeps track of your progress - visit the Stats section to learn more.
  * For extra challenge you can try and guess the game on screenshot too.
* [Forsen is live!](https://forsen.horse/rage-ban-game/)
  * A psychological horror about a life of an asylum streamer.
  * The asylum streamer in this game is you. You get to direct the daily 6 hour stream, and you have to stay sane during the adventure.
  * Best enjoyed with Twitch integration and active chat, but also works as a single-player game.
* [The Appeal Challenge](https://forsen.horse/unban-game/)
  * In this game you ~~role~~play as a person who just discovered Forsen's stream. Type some messages in chat and... Well, you'll see.
  * Fun and slightly challenging experience. But don't worry if you can't do it in first try.
* [Chattersen](https://forsen.horse/chattersen/)
  * Forsen does not type in his own chat very often. But when he does... Wait, really, when?
  * You get a couple of messages from Forsen's logs. You have to determine which message was sent earlier.
  * See how long you can keep up without a mistake.
* [Playlist shuffler](https://forsen.horse/playlist/)
  * Web-based YouTube jukebox. Designed to be as simple as possible.
  * Originally designed to shuffle songs from [Forsen's DMCA-free playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA4XEe9tV8qaSoneg5s5uJYo6HrWnT7T0), later expanded to support any playlist
  * Key features:
    * simple controls: start/stop, skip song, shuffle, volume slider
    * remembers shuffle state when you revisit (no more "same 3 songs")
    * auto-shuffle on playlist load (optional: reshuffle on every reload)
    * shuffles ALL songs (not the first 200)
    * automatically skips unavailable/private videos
    * allows to use your own playlists
* [Soundboard](https://forsen.horse/soundboard/)
  * A collection of Forsen lines, represented as a neat soundboard.
  * Sound library is split into categories, and search bar allows for a quick lookup.
  * Source: Forsen's lines collection at [badoge/soundboard](https://github.com/badoge/soundboard)
* And a bunch of other stuff, which is mostly experimental, broken, outdated, or cringe.
