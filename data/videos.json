When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is \"fixer\" Mike Erhmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts \"criminal\" in \"criminal lawyer.\"\n\n#BetterCallSaul #BreakingBad #Sony\n\n\"Agreed Amount Or No Deal\" | Pimento | Better Call Saul\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/breakingbad/featured",

Tracked for years by obsessed FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), the young mastermind was able to slip through his fingers multiple times, enjoying himself in the process. The con artist's foremost crime was check fraud which he carried out so expertly that by the end of the movie he gets recruited by the FBI to help them with check forgery cases. \n\nCredits: ¬© 2002 Paramount Pictures.

Lyrics below:\n\nIs this the real life?\nIs this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide\nNo escape from reality\nOpen your eyes\nLook up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go\nA little high, little low\nAnyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me\n\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head\nPulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\nMama, ooo\nDidn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters\n\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine\nBody's aching all the time\nGoodbye everybody - I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)\nI don't want to die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango\nThunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me\nGallileo, Gallileo,\nGallileo, Gallileo,\nGallileo Figaro - magnifico\n\nBut I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\nEasy come easy go - will you let me go\nBismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go - let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go - let me go\nWill not let you go - let me go (never)\nNever let you go - let me go\nNever let me go - ooo\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no -\nOh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me\nfor me\nfor me\n\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die\nOh baby - can't do this to me baby\nJust gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here\n\nOoh yeah, ooh yeah\nNothing really matters\nAnyone can see\nNothing really matters - nothing really matters to me\n\nAnyway the wind blows...\n\n#QueenTheGreatest #BohemianRhapsody #Remastered #Queen\n\nSubscribe to the official Queen channel Here https://Queen.lnk.to/Subscribe\nWatch more: https://Queen.lnk.to/OfficialMusicVideos\n\nAbout Queen:\nWelcome to the official Queen channel.

The short film for this No. 1 single, directed by Steve Barron, made history as the first video by a black artist to receive heavy rotation on MTV, and was later ranked by the network as one of the 100 greatest music videos of all time.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to the official Michael Jackson YouTube Channel: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/subscribeYD\r\n\r\nWatch more Michael Jackson videos: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_listenYC/youtube\r\n\r\nFollow Michael Jackson: \r\nFacebook: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followFI \r\nTwitter: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followTI\r\nInstagram: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followII \r\nWebsite: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followWI \r\nSpotify: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followSI\r\n\r\nWritten & Composed by Michael Jackson\r\nProduced by Quincy Jones for Quincy Jones Productions\r\nCo-Produced by Michael Jackson for MJJ Productions, Inc.\r\nFrom the album Thriller, released November 30, 1982\r\nReleased as a single January 2, 1983\r\n\r\nTHE SHORT FILM\r\nDirector: Steve Barron\r\nPrimary Production Location: Los Angeles, California\r\n\r\nMichael Jackson's short film for \"Billie Jean\" was the first of three short films produced for recordings from Thriller, which continues its reign as the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales in excess of 105 million as of June 1, 2016 and in December, 2015 became the first ever album to be awarded triple diamond status by the RIAA for US sales alone. The \"\"Billie Jean\"\" single reached No. 1 in 10 countries in the spring of 1983, including seven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 - becoming the second-highest selling single in America that same year.\r\n\r\n\"Billie Jean\" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 4, 1983, and Platinum on February 4, 1989. The song won two Grammy Awards for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance - Male, as well as an American Music Award for Favorite Single - Pop/Rock and was also named the Single of the Year on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll in 1983.\r\n\r\nThe short film featured a paparazzo attempting to photograph Jackson as he danced through an urban landscape. A specially created set featured steps and sidewalk tiles that lit up underneath Michael's feet. It is here that fans first saw some of Michael's best-known dance moves, such as spinning and landing on his toes. Many of Michael's steps and mannerisms in the video would become forever associated with The King of Pop.\r\n\r\nWhen the chorus hit.he sprung into this dance that was unlike anything I'd ever seen, director Steve Barron recounted of Jackson's choreography in the video. \"It was just extraordinary, instinctive. He pulled it all together and turned it into what we saw.The camera literally steamed up, the eyepiece steamed up, because of my heat from what I was seeing.\" Barron also recalled the crew breaking into spontaneous applause after Michael finished dancing.\r\n\r\nThe \"Billie Jean\" short film made history as the first video by a black artist to be played in heavy rotation on MTV, then in its second year. In 1992, the short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. MTV ranked \"Billie Jean\" as the 35th greatest music video of all time in 1999, one of three entries of Jackson's on the chart alongside \"Thriller\" and \"Beat It.\"\r\n\r\n#MichaelJackson #BillieJean #Thriller",

In keeping with the lyrical message of the song, which is strongly identified with Michael Jackson and reflective of his own philosophies, the short film tells a story through powerful images of oppression, homelessness, hunger, police brutality and other ills of the world as well as events and leaders of the 20th century whose work embodies the song‚Äôs message to ‚Äúmake that change.‚Äù Michael is only featured briefly in a crowd shot toward the end of the film.  Rolling Stone praised the short film in 2014 as ‚Äúa powerful statement to deliver to personality-driven MTV‚Äù and included it on the list of Michael‚Äôs 20 greatest short films.  ‚ÄúMan In The Mirror‚Äù is the fourth of five consecutive No.1 singles from the album making Michael the first artist to achieve this milestone.\n\nSubscribe to the official Michael Jackson YouTube Channel: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/subscribeYD\n \nFollow Michael Jackson:\nFacebook: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followYS/facebook\nTwitter: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followYS/twitter\nInstagram: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followYS/instagram\nWebsite: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followYS/websitegeneral\nSpotify: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_followYS/spotify\n\n \nChorus:\nI'm starting with the man in the mirror\nI'm asking him to change his ways\nAnd no message could have been any clearer\nIf you want to make the world a better place\n(If you want to make the world a better place)\nTake a look at yourself, and then make a change\n(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)\n(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)\n \n#MichaelJackson #ManInTheMirror #Bad",

      "description": "Credits to dollyon-line.com for the gorgeous photo of Dolly.\n\n\"9 to 5\" is the title of a Grammy-winning, number-one song written and originally performed by Dolly Parton for the 1980 film comedy Nine to Five, starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Parton in her film debut.\n\nThe film's title song garnered Parton an Academy Award nomination and four Grammy Award nominations, winning her the awards for \"Best Country Song\" and \"Best Country Vocal Performance, Female\". In addition to appearing on the film soundtrack, the song was the centerpiece of Parton's 9 to 5 and Odd Jobs album, released in late 1980. The song was released as a single in November 1980 and reached number one on both the Billboard Country Chart and the Billboard Hot 100 in January and February of 1981, respectively. For a time, the song became something of an anthem for office workers in the U.S., and as recently as 2004 Parton's song ranked number seventy-eight on American Film Institute's \"100 years, 100 songs\".

      "description": "Angels (Official Music Video)\n\nThe fourth single from 'Life Thru A Lens', and the first song that Robbie wrote with Guy Chambers. Released as a single at the beginning of December 1997, it spent twelve consecutive weeks on the UK Top 10 and peaked at No. 4. It has returned to the chart on numerous occasions in the intervening years, with streaming figures now in excess of 380 million. \n\nA public vote for the 2005 BRIT Awards, where Robbie performed the song as a duet with Joss Stone, named 'Angels' the best song in the previous twenty-five years. In June 2018, his chosen duet partner was Taylor Swift, when the pair performed 'Angels' onstage at Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nThe promo video for 'Angels' was filmed at Staunton Sands, a beach on the North Devon Coast in England, and directed by Vaughan Arnell. Vaughan had directed videos for the Spice Girls and George Michael, and would work with Robbie again on multiple projects.\n\nFollow Robbie online:\n \nSign up: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/signup\nYouTube: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/Watch\nInstagram: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/Instagram\nTwitter: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/Twitter\nFacebook: https://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/Facebook\n \nListen to more from Robbie: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/ListenNow",

Those live events include the 1999 BRIT Awards (where Robbie went home with trophies for Best British Male Solo Artist, Single Of The Year and Video Of The Year), the Live 8 concert held at Hyde Park, London in 2005, and at Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Concert in 2012.\n\nIn a poll conducted for the mental health charity Mind, 'Let Me Entertain You' was judged to be one of the top three songs for inducing a feeling of happiness.\n\nFor the promo video, Robbie chose to work with director Vaughan Arnell again. Filmed at The Roundhouse in Camden, north London it saw Robbie don a tight latex catsuit and facepaint inspired by American Rock band Kiss.\n\nFollow Robbie online:\n \nSign up: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/signup\nYouTube: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/Watch\nInstagram: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/Instagram\nTwitter: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/Twitter\nFacebook: https://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/Facebook\n \nListen to more from Robbie: http://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/ListenNow",

What does your company take me for?\n\nBlack bandana, sweet Louisiana\nRobbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana\nShe's a runner, rebel and a stunner\nOh her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna\nLookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty five\nJust another way to survive\n\n[Chorus:]\nCalifornia rest in peace\nSimultaneous release\nCalifornia show your teeth\nShe's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah\n\nShe's a lover baby and a fighter\nShoulda seen her coming when it got a little brighter\nWith a name like Dani California\nDay was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya\nA little loaded, she was stealin' another breath\nI love my baby to death\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWho knew the other side of you?\nWho knew what others died to prove?\nToo true to say good bye to you\nToo true to say say say...\n\nPush the fader, gifted animator\nOne for the now and eleven for the later\nNever made it up to Minnesota\nNorth Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota\n\nDown in the badlands she was savin' the best for last\nIt only hurts when I laugh\nGone too fast...\n\n#OfficialMusicVideo #RedHotChiliPeppers #DaniCalifornia #WeAreWarnerRecords",
